<h1 style="font-size:40px;">WHY ORGAN DONATION IS IMPORTANT??</h1>


<br>

<h2>Another name is added to the national transplant waiting list every 10 minutes.
On average, 20 people die every day from the lack of available organs for transplant.
One decreased donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation and can save and enhance more than 100 lives through the lifesaving and healing gift of tissue donation.Organ recipients are selected based primarily on medical need, location and compatibility.
<br><br>Organs that can be donated after death are the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and small intestines. Tissues include corneas, skin, veins, heart valves, tendons, ligaments and bones.
<br><br>A healthy person can become a 'living donor' by donating a kidney, or a part of the liver, lung, intestine, blood or bone marrow.
<br><br>
The buying and selling of human organs is not allowed for transplants in America, but it is allowed for research purposes.
In most countries, it is illegal to buy and sell human organs for transplants, but international black markets for organs are growing in response to the increased demand around the world. Learn more about Transplant Tourism.
Liver and kidney disease kills over 120,000 each year, more people than Alzheimer’s, breast cancer, or prostate cancer.
1 in 9 or 26 million Americans have kidney disease – and most don’t even know it.
Organ disease is a massive public health issue, and organ transplantation can be a lifesaving treatment option. There are as many people dying per year of organ disease as are on the transplant waiting list currently
