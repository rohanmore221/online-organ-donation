# organ-donation-system
•	The basic idea behind project is to ease the process of organ donation and make it hassle free.
•	We provide four types of users : Donor , Receiver ,Doctor and Admin .
•	When a Donor log’s in , he can view his report history updated by doctor and can confirm if ready to donate immediately.
•	When a Receiver log’s in, he can view his current waiting number and report history updated by doctor .
•	When Doctor log’s in , he can add patient report , view patient’s history , check list of available donors for emergency receiver , can remove patient after performing operation and can view waiting list of receivers.
•	When Admin log’s in , he can check list of all registered users and feedback of visitors.
•	Also, it includes news and inspirational stories related to organ donation, which helps both donor and receiver to have awareness of the process .
