            Mr. Bharani Kumar, 49yrs old male was working in a private sector company and taking care of his family. He had one daughter and lived in Red hills.

When the counselors approached the family members they wanted to donate his organs and support the social cause. Even in their intense grief, the family members cooperated and fulfilled his wish by helping others.<br><br>

We respect Mr. Bharani Kumar's family for their courageous decision and for giving new life.
